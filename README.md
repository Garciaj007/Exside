Our First Game- with my team members

This is the first game I made for Game programming, for the first semester statring. It is an endless space invader made in unity, and contains simple mechanics and code, this was also my first time using Post Prossessing Profiles and just coding a Unity Game, The game slowly progresses in difficulty and contains a main menu, reset, and high score.
